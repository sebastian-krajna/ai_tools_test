## **Prompt Used**

"Create a Flutter app that implements a modern to-do list with these features:

1. Task management:  
   * Add new tasks with title, description, priority (low/medium/high), and due date  
   * Mark tasks as complete  
   * Delete tasks  
   * Edit existing tasks  
2. User interface:  
   * Clean, modern Material Design 3 UI with proper theming  
   * Task list with sorting options (by priority, due date, completion status)  
   * Task details view  
   * Form for adding/editing tasks  
   * Visual indicators for priority and due date status  
   * Animation for completing tasks  
3. State management:  
   * Implement using a Provider pattern  
   * Persist data locally using either Hive or SharedPreferences  
   * Handle state changes efficiently  
4. Code quality:  
   * Follow SOLID principles  
   * Separate UI from business logic

## **Overall Assessment**

Each implementation has successfully met the basic requirements for a to-do app, but with different approaches:

1. **Cursor** provides a clean, well-structured codebase that balances simplicity and functionality, using SharedPreferences for storage. This is the most straightforward implementation that would be easiest for beginners to understand. The implementation worked correctly without needing fixes.

2. **Copilot** focuses on functionality in fewer files, with most of the implementation in a single main file, using Hive for storage. This approach favors quick implementation over long-term maintainability. The implementation worked correctly without significant issues.

3. **Aider** delivers a structured implementation with proper service abstraction, comprehensive documentation, and enhanced models, also using Hive for storage. This implementation would scale well for larger applications but required manual fixes to correct minor errors in the generated code.

4. **Claude** provides a well-balanced implementation with clean architecture, comprehensive error handling, and a polished UI. It includes basic testing and uses Hive with service abstraction for storage. This implementation offers a good balance between simplicity and maintainability with no significant issues.

5. **AugmentedCode** represents a comprehensive implementation with multiple test examples, robust error handling, and polished UI components. It follows best practices closely and would be maintainable for larger projects, but might be considered overengineered for the simple to-do app requested in the prompt.

6. **Windsurf** provides a well-organized implementation with logical separation of concerns, good documentation, and comprehensive light/dark theme support with system preference. It includes unit tests for the provider logic and stable implementation with error handling.

The differences highlight each tool's approach to code organization, documentation, and architectural choices while meeting the same functional requirements. The choice between these implementations would depend on the project's long-term goals, team size, and complexity requirements. If reliability of the generated code is a priority, Cursor and Copilot produced more immediately functional implementations.
