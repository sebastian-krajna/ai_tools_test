## **Prompt Used**

"Create a Flutter app that implements a modern to-do list with these features:

1. Task management:  
   * Add new tasks with title, description, priority (low/medium/high), and due date  
   * Mark tasks as complete  
   * Delete tasks  
   * Edit existing tasks  
2. User interface:  
   * Clean, modern Material Design 3 UI with proper theming  
   * Task list with sorting options (by priority, due date, completion status)  
   * Task details view  
   * Form for adding/editing tasks  
   * Visual indicators for priority and due date status  
   * Animation for completing tasks  
3. State management:  
   * Implement using a Provider pattern  
   * Persist data locally using either Hive or SharedPreferences  
   * Handle state changes efficiently  
4. Code quality:  
   * Follow SOLID principles  
   * Separate UI from business logic  
   * Include appropriate comments  
   * Implement error handling  
   * Add basic unit tests for the main functionality

Please provide complete, runnable code with proper project structure and all necessary files. The app should be ready to run without requiring additional implementation. If you need to make architectural decisions, prefer simplicity and clarity over complex patterns. Explain any key design decisions in comments within the code."
