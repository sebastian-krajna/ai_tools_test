# Flutter AI Tool Comparative Analysis

## Objective
Create a detailed comparison and analysis of different AI tools (Aider, Augment Code, Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini, and Windsurf) based on their Flutter to-do application implementations.

## Process Instructions
1. Use the separate evaluation files (evaluation_aider.md, evaluation_augment_code.md, etc.) as the source material.
2. Extract data from each evaluation systematically to create direct comparisons.
3. Present information in a way that highlights relative strengths and weaknesses.
4. Use visual representations (tables, charts) where appropriate for clarity.
5. Provide both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analysis.

## SECTION 1: Requirements Compliance Comparison

Create a table comparing the completion status of key requirements across all tools:

| Requirement | Aider | Augment Code | Copilot | Cursor | Claude Code | Gemini | Windsurf |
|-------------|-------|--------------|---------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Task Management Completion** | % | % | % | % | % | % | % |
| **UI Implementation Completion** | % | % | % | % | % | % | % |
| **State Management Completion** | % | % | % | % | % | % | % |
| **Code Quality Compliance** | % | % | % | % | % | % | % |
| **Overall Completion** | % | % | % | % | % | % | % |

Include a brief analysis of which tools excelled at implementing the basic requirements versus which had notable omissions.

## SECTION 2: Implementation Quality Comparison

Extract and compare the scores given in each evaluation:

| Category | Aider | Augment Code | Copilot | Cursor | Claude Code | Gemini | Windsurf |
