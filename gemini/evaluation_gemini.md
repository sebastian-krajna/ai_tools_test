## SECTION 8: Specific Code Examples

### Strongest Code Examples
1. **Task Model with CopyWith Pattern**
```dart
Task copyWith({
  String? title,
  String? description,
  Priority? priority,
  DateTime? dueDate,
  bool? isCompleted,
}) {
  return Task(
    id: id,
    title: title ?? this.title,
    description: description ?? this.description,
    priority: priority ?? this.priority,
    dueDate: dueDate ?? this.dueDate,
    isCompleted: isCompleted ?? this.isCompleted,
  );
}
```
Why it's strong: Clean implementation of the copyWith pattern for immutable updates to model objects, making state updates cleaner and less error-prone.

2. **StorageService JSON Serialization**
```dart
Future<List<Task>> loadTasks() async {
  try {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    final tasksString = prefs.getString(_tasksKey);
    if (tasksString == null) {
      return [];
    }
    final List<dynamic> tasksJson = jsonDecode(tasksString);
    return tasksJson.map((json) {
      return Task(
        id: json['id'],
        title: json['title'],
        description: json['description'],
        priority: Priority.values.byName(json['priority']),
        dueDate: json['dueDate'] != null ? DateTime.parse(json['dueDate']) : null,
        isCompleted: json['isCompleted'],
      );
    }).toList();
  } catch (e) {
    print("Error loading tasks from storage: $e");
    return []; 
  }
}
```
Why it's strong: Well-structured serialization with proper error handling and null checking. Handles complex types like enums and DateTime.

3. **TaskProvider State Management**
```dart
Future<void> toggleTaskCompletion(String taskId) async {
  try {
    final index = _tasks.indexWhere((task) => task.id == taskId);
    if (index != -1) {
      _tasks[index] = _tasks[index].copyWith(isCompleted: !_tasks[index].isCompleted);
      await _storageService.saveTasks(_tasks);
      notifyListeners();
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print("Error toggling task completion: $e");
  }
}
```
Why it's strong: Clean business logic with error handling, using the copyWith pattern for immutable updates, and properly notifying listeners only after storage is updated.

### Code That Needs Improvement

1. **Incomplete Sorting Implementation**
```dart
void sortTasks(SortOption option) {
  // Implement sorting logic based on the SortOption enum
  // You can add an enum to represent different sorting criteria (priority, due date, completion status)
  // and use the `sort` method on the `_tasks` list.
  notifyListeners(); // Notify listeners after sorting
}
```
Issue: This method is a placeholder with comments but no actual implementation. The UI has sorting options that don't function.

2. **Direct Service Instantiation**
```dart
class TaskProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  final List<Task> _tasks = [];
  final StorageService _storageService = StorageService();
  
  // Rest of the class...
}
```
Issue: Direct instantiation creates tight coupling. Better to use dependency injection to provide the StorageService, improving testability.

3. **Limited Error Feedback**
```dart
catch (e) {
  // Handle error
  print("Error adding task: $e");
}
```
Issue: Error handling only prints to console but doesn't provide user feedback. Should implement UI error states or notifications.

## SECTION 9: Overall Assessment

1. Clean separation of concerns with appropriate directory structure
2. Good implementation of Provider pattern for state management
3. Comprehensive basic functionality with proper model design

### Critical Areas for Improvement
