### Code Status
The codebase is complete and ready to run. All necessary components are present:
- Main app structure (`main.dart`)
- Models and adapters for data persistence (`task.dart`, `task.g.dart`, `task_priority_adapter.dart`)
- Provider implementations for state management
- Screen and widget implementations
- Unit tests for core functionality

The code is syntactically correct and follows modern Dart practices, including null safety implementation throughout. There are no apparent unfinished parts or placeholders in the codebase.

## 2. Architecture and Organization

### Project Structure
The project follows a logical and well-organized structure:

```
lib/
├── models/        # Data models and adapters
├── providers/     # State management
├── screens/       # Main application screens
└── widgets/       # Reusable UI components
```

This structure separates concerns effectively and makes the codebase easy to navigate.

### Design Patterns
The application effectively uses several design patterns:

1. **Provider Pattern**: For state management and dependency injection
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted in the `TaskProvider` for data access
3. **Factory Pattern**: In task creation and modification methods
4. **Builder Pattern**: In UI construction with proper composition
5. **Adapter Pattern**: For Hive data serialization with custom adapters

### SOLID Principles Adherence

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Classes have well-defined responsibilities
   - `Task` model focuses solely on data structure
   - `TaskProvider` handles data operations
   - UI components focus on presentation

2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification
   - `Task` model has a `copyWith` method for non-destructive updates (lines 46-61)
   - Provider classes expose methods for extensions without modifying core logic

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes properly extend base types
   - Proper inheritance in widget hierarchy
   - No violations of parent class behavior

4. **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clean API boundaries
   - Focused interfaces with appropriate method sets
   - No bloated interfaces forcing unnecessary implementations

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Higher-level modules don't depend on lower-level modules
   - UI components depend on abstract state from providers
   - Screens don't directly manipulate data storage

### Layer Separation
The code demonstrates clear separation between:

1. **Data Layer**: Models and persistence adapters
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Provider implementations
3. **UI Layer**: Screens and widgets

This separation ensures a clean architecture where concerns are properly isolated, facilitating maintenance and future extensions.

## 3. UI Implementation Quality

3. **Dismissible Animation**: Smooth swipe-to-delete functionality

### Visual Indicators
The application effectively uses visual indicators for task status:

1. **Priority Indicators**: Color-coded by priority level (red for high, orange for medium, green for low)
2. **Completion Status**: Strikethrough and opacity changes for completed tasks
3. **Due Date Indicators**: Visual warning for overdue tasks
4. **Clear Feedback**: Visual confirmation of actions and state changes

      title: 'Low Priority Task',
      description: 'Description',
      priority: TaskPriority.low,
      dueDate: DateTime.now().add(const Duration(days: 1)),
    ),
    Task(
      id: '3',
      title: 'High Priority Task',
      description: 'Description',
      priority: TaskPriority.high,
      dueDate: DateTime.now().add(const Duration(days: 3)),
    ),
    // ...
  ];
  
  // Create a custom sorter based on the priority logic in TaskProvider
  final sortedTasks = List<Task>.from(tasks)
    ..sort((a, b) => b.priority.index.compareTo(a.priority.index));
  
  // Verify sorting order
  expect(sortedTasks[0].id, '3'); // High priority
