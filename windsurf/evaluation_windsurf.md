## SECTION 8: Specific Code Examples

### Strongest Code Examples
1. **Example 1**
```dart
// From lib/providers/task_provider.dart
Future<void> toggleTaskCompletion(String taskId) async {
  _setLoading(true);
  try {
    final index = _tasks.indexWhere((task) => task.id == taskId);
    if (index != -1) {
      final task = _tasks[index];
      _tasks[index] = task.copyWith(isCompleted: !task.isCompleted);
      await _saveTasksToStorage();
      _error = null;
    } else {
      _error = 'Task not found';
    }
  } catch (e) {
    _error = 'Failed to toggle task completion: $e';
  } finally {
    _setLoading(false);
  }
}
```
Why it's strong: This method demonstrates excellent error handling, proper state management, and immutability principles. It uses the copyWith pattern to create a new task instance rather than mutating the existing one, provides specific error messages, and properly manages loading state with try/catch/finally.

2. **Example 2**
```dart
// From lib/widgets/task_list_item.dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final theme = Theme.of(context);
  final colorScheme = theme.colorScheme;
  
  // Create a dismissible card for swipe-to-delete functionality
  return Dismissible(
    key: Key(task.id),
    direction: DismissDirection.endToStart,
    background: Container(
      alignment: Alignment.centerRight,
      padding: const EdgeInsets.only(right: 20),
      color: Colors.red,
      child: const Icon(
        Icons.delete,
        color: Colors.white,
      ),
    ),
    onDismissed: (_) => onDelete(),
    child: Card(
      /* ... */
    ),
  );
}
```
Why it's strong: This widget implementation shows excellent composition, creating a reusable task list item with swipe-to-delete functionality. It uses proper theming by accessing the theme context and provides good visual feedback for user actions.

3. **Example 3**
```dart
// From lib/utils/date_formatter.dart
static String getRelativeDateDescription(DateTime? date) {
  if (date == null) return 'No due date';
  
  final now = DateTime.now();
  final today = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day);
  final dueDate = DateTime(date.year, date.month, date.day);
  final difference = dueDate.difference(today).inDays;
  
  if (difference < 0) return 'Overdue by ${-difference} day${-difference > 1 ? 's' : ''}';
  if (difference == 0) return 'Due today';
  if (difference == 1) return 'Due tomorrow';
  return '$difference days left';
}
```
Why it's strong: This utility method demonstrates excellent date handling with clear, user-friendly output. It handles multiple cases (overdue, today, tomorrow, future) and even includes proper pluralization. It's also well-encapsulated in a utility class, promoting reuse.

### Code That Needs Improvement

1. **Example 1**
```dart
// From lib/screens/task_list_screen.dart
void _deleteTask(String taskId) {
  final taskProvider = Provider.of<TaskProvider>(context, listen: false);
  final taskName = taskProvider.tasks
      .firstWhere((task) => task.id == taskId)
      .title;
  
  taskProvider.deleteTask(taskId);
  
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    SnackBar(
      content: Text('Task "$taskName" deleted'),
      action: SnackBarAction(
        label: 'Undo',
        onPressed: () {
          // This would require additional functionality to implement
          // For now, just show a message that it's not implemented
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            const SnackBar(
              content: Text('Undo functionality not implemented'),
              duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
            ),
          );
        },
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```
Issue: This method shows an "Undo" button that doesn't actually work. It would be better to either implement the undo functionality or not show the button at all. Also, firstWhere could throw an exception if the task isn't found, which isn't handled.

2. **Example 2**
```dart
// From lib/services/storage_service.dart
Future<List<Task>> loadTasks() async {
  try {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    final tasksJson = prefs.getStringList(_tasksKey) ?? [];
    
    return tasksJson
        .map((taskJson) => Task.fromJson(jsonDecode(taskJson)))
        .toList();
  } catch (e) {
    // Log error and return empty list to prevent app crash
    print('Error loading tasks: $e');
    return [];
  }
}
```
Issue: The error handling simply prints to the console and returns an empty list. A better approach would be to use a proper logging system and potentially notify the caller of the error through a return type that can represent both success and failure (like Result pattern).

3. **Example 3**
```dart
// From lib/screens/edit_task_screen.dart
// Validate form and update state
void _validateForm() {
  setState(() {
    _isValid = _titleController.text.trim().isNotEmpty;
  });
}
```
Issue: The form validation is very basic, only checking if the title is not empty. A more robust implementation would include additional validation logic for other fields, potentially use a Form widget with FormField validators, and provide user feedback about what's missing.
