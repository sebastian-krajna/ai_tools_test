Please provide a thorough analysis and evaluation of the Flutter application code that will be presented below. The application was meant to be created according to the following prompt:
## **Prompt Used**
"Create a Flutter app that implements a modern to-do list with these features:

1. Task management:
   * Add new tasks with title, description, priority (low/medium/high), and due date
   * Mark tasks as complete
   * Delete tasks
   * Edit existing tasks

2. User interface:
   * Clean, modern Material Design 3 UI with proper theming
   * Task list with sorting options (by priority, due date, completion status)
   * Task details view
   * Form for adding/editing tasks
   * Visual indicators for priority and due date status
   * Animation for completing tasks

3. State management:
   * Implement using a Provider pattern
   * Persist data locally using either Hive or SharedPreferences
   * Handle state changes efficiently

4. Code quality:
   * Follow SOLID principles
   * Separate UI from business logic
   * Include appropriate comments
   * Implement error handling
   * Add basic unit tests for the main functionality"
Evaluation Criteria:
Please create a Markdown file with a comprehensive assessment of the application according to the following criteria:
1. Code Completeness and Correctness

Does the application include all required features from the prompt?

Is the code self-documenting (readable variable names, functions, etc.)?
Is any additional documentation included?

6. Testing Strategy

Are basic unit tests implemented?
What is the quality and coverage of the tests?
Are the tests effective in verifying functionality?

7. Error Handling

Summary
Please provide a final summary of the application assessment with an overall verdict on whether the application meets all requirements from the original prompt. Also include the implementation's strengths and areas that need improvement.
The evaluation result should be saved as a Markdown file and include a detailed analysis of each of the above criteria, with specific code examples where possible.
