## SECTION 8: Specific Code Examples

### Strongest Code Examples
1. **Task Model with Immutability Support**
```dart
// task.dart:47-63
Task copyWith({
  String? title,
  String? description,
  TaskPriority? priority,
  DateTime? dueDate,
  bool? isCompleted,
}) {
  return Task(
    id: id,
    title: title ?? this.title,
    description: description ?? this.description,
    priority: priority ?? this.priority,
    dueDate: dueDate ?? this.dueDate,
    isCompleted: isCompleted ?? this.isCompleted,
    createdAt: createdAt,
  );
}
```
Why it's strong: Implements the copyWith pattern for immutable state management, making it easy to create updated copies of tasks without mutation.

2. **Sorted Tasks Getter in TaskProvider**
```dart
// task_provider.dart:31-68
List<Task> get sortedTasks {
  final tasksCopy = List<Task>.from(_tasks);
  
  switch (_sortOption) {
    case TaskSortOption.priority:
      tasksCopy.sort((a, b) {
        final comparison = a.priority.index.compareTo(b.priority.index);
        return _sortAscending ? comparison : -comparison;
      });
    
    case TaskSortOption.dueDate:
      tasksCopy.sort((a, b) {
        if (a.dueDate == null && b.dueDate == null) return 0;
        if (a.dueDate == null) return _sortAscending ? 1 : -1;
        if (b.dueDate == null) return _sortAscending ? -1 : 1;
        
        final comparison = a.dueDate!.compareTo(b.dueDate!);
        return _sortAscending ? comparison : -comparison;
      });
    
    // Additional cases...
  }
  
  return tasksCopy;
}
```
Why it's strong: Implements a robust sorting system that handles null values and direction toggles. Creates a copy of the list to avoid modifying the original data.

3. **Relative Date Formatting Utility**
```dart
// date_formatter.dart:15-36
static String getRelativeDate(DateTime? date) {
  if (date == null) return 'No due date';
  
  final now = DateTime.now();
  final today = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day);
  final dateOnly = DateTime(date.year, date.month, date.day);
  
  final difference = dateOnly.difference(today).inDays;
  
  if (difference == 0) {
    return 'Today';
  } else if (difference == 1) {
    return 'Tomorrow';
  } else if (difference == -1) {
    return 'Yesterday';
  } else if (difference > 1) {
    return 'In $difference days';
  } else {
    return '${difference.abs()} days ago';
  }
}
```
Why it's strong: Clean, focused utility that improves the user experience by showing human-readable relative dates instead of just raw date values.

### Code That Needs Improvement

1. **Empty State Implementation in TaskListScreen**
```dart
// task_list_screen.dart:129-157
Widget _buildEmptyState(BuildContext context) {
  final theme = Theme.of(context);
  
  return Center(
    child: Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Icon(
          Icons.check_circle_outline,
          size: 80,
          color: theme.colorScheme.primary.withOpacity(0.5),
        ),
        const SizedBox(height: 16),
        Text(
          'No tasks yet',
          style: theme.textTheme.headlineSmall,
        ),
        const SizedBox(height: 8),
        Text(
          'Add your first task by tapping the button below',
          style: theme.textTheme.bodyLarge?.copyWith(
            color: theme.colorScheme.onSurface.withOpacity(0.7),
          ),
          textAlign: TextAlign.center,
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );
}
```
Issue: This is a good implementation but could be refactored into a reusable EmptyState widget since similar patterns might be needed elsewhere in the app.

2. **Priority Selection in TaskFormScreen**
```dart
// task_form_screen.dart:111-136
SegmentedButton<TaskPriority>(
  segments: TaskPriority.values.map((priority) {
    final color = AppTheme.getPriorityColor(context, priority);
    return ButtonSegment<TaskPriority>(
      value: priority,
      label: Text(priority.name),
      icon: Icon(Icons.flag, color: color),
    );
  }).toList(),
  selected: {_priority},
  onSelectionChanged: (Set<TaskPriority> selected) {
    setState(() {
      _priority = selected.first;
    });
  },
  style: ButtonStyle(
    backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.resolveWith<Color>(
      (Set<MaterialState> states) {
        if (states.contains(MaterialState.selected)) {
          return AppTheme.getPriorityBackgroundColor(context, _priority);
        }
        return theme.colorScheme.surface;
      },
    ),
  ),
)
```
Issue: While functional, this could be extracted into a reusable PrioritySelector widget that could be used in other screens as needed.

3. **Error Handling in TaskProvider**
```dart
// task_provider.dart:98-101
} catch (e) {
  debugPrint('Error adding task: $e');
  // Handle error
}
```
Issue: The error handling uses debugPrint but doesn't provide a mechanism for displaying errors to the user or recovering from failures. A more robust error handling strategy would improve the app's reliability.
